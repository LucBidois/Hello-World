Adjustable snake speed

higher is slower
let speed = 1; //Insane
let speed = 5;  // Master
let speed = 10; //Adept
let speed = 15; //Beginer
let speed = 20; 


Things I want to do
1. create some levels
2. getting an apple gives points based on control option (difficulty setting)
3. menu (needs to be designed first then set) (to be done at home where I can draw it properly?)
4. should I make game take up less of canvas so that scores can be displayed? - or display scores using other html elements.
5. make the snake movement smooth for speed < 5

 Control files
1. number of players (player 2 can be AI in the future)
2. scoreboard - save top 5 or top 10 scores in each game mode.
3. gamemodes - standard - walled - levels
4. standard => no walls - endless - unique scoreboard per difficulty choice? or apples worth different amounts depending on difficulty
5. walled => same as standard but with walls around edge (could do a endless gamemode with map choice)
6. levels => reach a number of points then exit opens to next level (reset length when next level starts)
